Hi, I’m McKenzie!
I am currently working as a data analyst for a third party administrator and work on solution scoping for the buildout of new client reports.
Along with claims data, I also have oncological data experience, as I worked at a cancer center in the Population Sciences department. I have experience 
with SAS, R, and SQL and am currently learning Python to hopefully experiment with machine learning. 

My goal is to retain the knowledge attained during my schooling while continuing to learn new statistical methods. My projects will mainly reflect independent 
practice.
