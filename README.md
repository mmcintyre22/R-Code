Hi, I’m McKenzie!
I am currently working as a data analyst for a third party administrator and work on solution scoping for the buildout of new client reports.
Along with claims data, I also have oncological data experience, as I worked at a cancer center in the Population Sciences department. I have experience 
with SAS, R, and SQL and am currently learning Python to hopefully experiment with machine learning.
